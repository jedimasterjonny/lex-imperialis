# bin

Scripts backing the pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, run by `make
pre-commit` in the lint CI gate) and the Makefile.

## check-role-test-coverage.sh

Enforces the test-coverage contract over `roles/`: every role ships a
`molecule/default` (incus) or `molecule/libvirt` scenario; a `libvirt` scenario
requires a `molecule/hetzner` one (its real-VM CI form); and each role in the
hardcoded Leap-16 subset (`leap_roles`) ships a `molecule/leap` scenario. Exits
non-zero listing every gap; runs on every commit, ignoring filenames.

## check-jinja-syntax.py

Parses every `*.j2` handed to it, failing on a Jinja syntax error that would
otherwise surface only when Ansible templates the file — a converge, or a
`gitops_reconcile` apply. The usual cause is a bare `{#` outside a `{% raw %}`
fence, which bash's `${#array[@]}` supplies; `shellcheck-jinja.sh` rewrites
`{% … %}` and `{{ … }}` but not comment tags, so it cannot catch one. Parsing
resolves no variables and looks up no filters, so Ansible-only filters do not
trip it. Needs the venv (jinja2, via ansible-core).

## gen-fixture-hostvars.py

Projects each fleet play's `vars:` block into
`roles/fleet/molecule/default/inventory/group_vars/<group>.yml`, the fixtures the
composed-fleet scenario converges against, and holds that scenario's `converge.yml`
role list to the play's. Backs the `gen-fixture-hostvars` hook, which regenerates
and fails the commit on drift, so neither can become a second source of truth.
Extend `PLAYS` alongside the instance that converges the shape. Needs the venv
(PyYAML).

## shellcheck-jinja.sh

Shellchecks the shell-in-Jinja templates the plain `shellcheck` hook skips —
`identify` tags them jinja, not shell: every `*.sh.j2`, plus the
extensionless-bash `wp`/`wp-db-dump` templates. Rewrites Jinja to valid shell
first (`{% … %}` → `:`, `{{ … }}` → `X`), then pipes the result through
shellcheck.

## tofu-validate.sh

Validates `terraform/` offline: `tofu init -backend=false` (skips the GCS state
backend, so no cloud credentials are needed) then `tofu validate`. Backs the
`tofu-validate` hook.

## vault-var.sh

Prints one top-level variable's value from the ansible-vault, bridging a vault
secret into a `TF_VAR_` (Terraform can't read the vault). Backs the
`tofu-plan`/`tofu-apply` make targets and the `terraform.yml` plan workflow.
Needs the venv and `.vault_pass`.
